# Diabetes-Prediction-System

**Diabetes Prediction System with Flask UI and Machine Learning Models**

This repository contains code for a diabetes prediction system developed as part of a risk prediction internship project. The project aims to create a user-friendly web application using Flask as the backend framework and incorporating two machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for predicting the risk of diabetes in individuals.

**Project Overview**
The main goal of this project is to develop an intuitive web-based platform that allows users to input various health-related parameters and obtain predictions about their likelihood of having diabetes. The system utilizes the following components:

**Flask UI:** The frontend of the application is built using Flask, providing a seamless user interface for inputting data and displaying predictions.
**Logistic Regression Model:** Implemented a Logistic Regression algorithm trained on labeled datasets to predict the probability of diabetes based on input features.
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:** Employed a KNN algorithm to classify individuals into risk categories based on similarity to other data points.
**Acknowledgments**
This project was completed as part of a risk prediction internship program. Special thanks to the mentors and contributors for their guidance and support throughout the development process.
